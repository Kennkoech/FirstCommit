			<h3>What makes a successful photographer?</h3>
			<p class="intro">
				Photography is all about passion and your willingness to go out of your way and get the best snaps. You can choose to do portraits, wildlife, scenery or you can be a jack of all trades and do them all. But it is best to focus on one and be a beast at it, get it?.
			</p>
			<h4>Do you really have to start with top notch lenses and such?</h4>
			<p>
				Well no. You can start with your simple camera with basic lenses and upgrade as you go. Photography is also a learning process. Something you get better at day after day. So the more you practise, the better you get at it.

			<h4>Traits of a good photographer</h4>
			<h5>Passion</h5>
			<p>
				A good photographer needs to be passionate. You need to like what you do and that will help you grow. You need to enjoy it and that will help you do more.
			</p>
			<h5>Spontaneous</h5>
			<p>
				You need to always be spontaneous. Chap chap in what you do. The more snaps you take, the higher your chances of geting one that is just spectacular.
			</p>
			<h5>Hard work</h5>
			<p>
				This is almost obvious for anything to be a success. You need to be able to go out of your way and get amazing snaps. Especially wildlife photographers. Categorically, wildlife is more dangerous than all the rest but if you have passion for it, you'll definitely make it.
